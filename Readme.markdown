## Building

You'll need [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) to build the app. To install CocoaPods, run the following command in Terminal:

    $ sudo gem install cocoapods

Once you have CocoaPods installed, run the following command to install Words' dependencies:

    $ pod install

Now, open `Words.xcworkspace` in Xcode 6 and simply click run.
